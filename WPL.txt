1. DEFINITIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Wake" refers to the Wake Runtime, JIT Engine, associated runtime components
and modules (including but not limited to .dll, .so, .a, .lib, .sm, .wpkg, .jc,
and any other Wake-specific formats), tools, headers, and all related software
distributed by Majify Technologies Inc.

"Majify" refers to Majify Technologies Inc., the copyright holder and
exclusive licensor of Wake and its components.

"Personal or Educational Use" means use by an individual for personal learning,
research, experimentation, or internal development not involving any
commercial, revenue-generating, or business activity.

"Commercial Use" means any use of Wake or its components in connection with
a paid product, service, or internal business operation that generates or
intends to generate revenue, directly or indirectly.

"Derivative Work" means any modification, integration, adaptation, or
extension of Wake or its components, whether distributed or not.
Derivative Work excludes works that merely use Wake's public APIs, scripting
interfaces, or JIT runtime without incorporating Wake's source code or
binary components.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. LICENSE GRANT – PERSONAL & EDUCATIONAL USE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Majify Technologies Inc. grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
non-transferable license to use Wake and its official libraries for
Personal or Educational Use, subject to the restrictions below.

You may:
- Install and use Wake on your personal computer or test environment;
- Create and test your own applications using the Wake runtime;
- Share screenshots, videos, or research findings using Wake for educational
  or non-commercial demonstration purposes.

You may NOT:
- Distribute or sell any product, module, or service that embeds, wraps, or
  relies on Wake or its libraries for commercial purposes;
- Redistribute the Wake binaries (.exe, .dll, .so, .lib) or any part thereof;
- Circumvent, remove, or alter any signature, verification, licensing, or
  security mechanism built into Wake;
- Reverse engineer, disassemble, or attempt to extract any private keys,
  tokens, or proprietary code from Wake or its components.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. COMMERCIAL USE AND FAIR THRESHOLD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake is free for individuals, students, and small independent teams defined as
organizations with fewer than five (5) full-time employees and less than
USD 500,000 in annual gross revenue derived from projects using Wake.

A valid Commercial License Agreement with Majify Technologies Inc. is required
if either of these thresholds is exceeded.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Products, software, or services sold for profit;
- Internal enterprise applications used for production or client delivery;
- Integration of Wake into any hardware or system sold commercially;
- Distribution of Wake-powered applications through app stores, SaaS
  platforms, or digital marketplaces.

This Fair Threshold aims to maintain fairness: independent creators keep
free access, while larger organizations contribute to sustaining the
development of Wake.

Commercial license terms may include per-seat, per-device, per-module, or
revenue-share models depending on usage and integration level.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake and all associated components are the exclusive property of
Majify Technologies Inc. This license does not transfer ownership.

Any feedback, ideas, or code contributions that you voluntarily submit directly
to the Wake project (such as pull requests, issue reports, or documentation
edits) may be used by Majify Technologies Inc. for any purpose under a
perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license, without transferring ownership
and without obligation of compensation.

This clause does not apply to independently developed modules, plugins, or
projects released under your own license, even if they interact with Wake
through its public APIs.

Trademarks "Wake", "Wake JIT Engine", "Majify", and related logos are
registered or pending trademarks of Majify Technologies Inc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. SECURITY AND SIGNING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake binaries and modules use digital signing (Ed25519) to verify integrity and
authenticity. Only modules signed by Majify or authorized partners are
recognized as official.

You may not alter or redistribute Wake binaries, headers, or manifests in a way
that bypasses or falsifies these security checks.

Security Disclaimer:
While Wake implements digital signing and verification mechanisms, no software
system can guarantee absolute protection against malicious code or
vulnerabilities. By using Wake, you acknowledge these inherent risks and agree
to use Wake at your own discretion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. OPEN-SOURCE COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open-source projects distributed under OSI-approved licenses may use Wake for
development, testing, or demonstration purposes, provided no commercial
distribution occurs and Wake itself is not redistributed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, express or implied,
including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, and non-infringement.

In no event shall Majify Technologies Inc. or its affiliates be liable for any
claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use or inability to use
Wake or its components.

Third-Party Code Disclaimer:
Majify Technologies Inc. is not responsible for third-party scripts, modules,
or code executed through the Wake runtime. Users are solely responsible for
verifying the origin, integrity, and safety of any `.jc` or `.wpkg` files they
choose to execute.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. TERMINATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any breach of this License immediately terminates your rights under it.
Upon termination, you must cease all use of Wake and destroy all copies.

Majify Technologies Inc. reserves the right to revoke licenses or access keys
if fraudulent, abusive, or unauthorized use is detected.

User Responsibility:
Users agree not to use Wake to develop, distribute, or execute malicious,
harmful, or unauthorized code, including but not limited to malware, exploits,
or data exfiltration tools. Majify Technologies Inc. reserves the right to
suspend or revoke access in such cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. GOVERNING LAW
