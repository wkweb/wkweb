1. DEFINITIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Wake" refers to the Wake Runtime, JIT Engine, associated components and
modules (including but not limited to .dll, .so, .a, .lib, .sm, .wpkg, .jc,
and any other Wake-specific formats), tools, headers, build systems, and all
related software distributed by Majify Technologies Inc.

"Majify" refers to Majify Technologies Inc., the copyright holder and exclusive
licensor of Wake.

"Personal or Educational Use" means use by an individual for personal learning,
research, hobby development, experimentation, or internal training, not tied
to any revenue-generating or business operations.

"Commercial Use" means any use of Wake in connection with a product, service,
tool, studio pipeline, or internal business activity that generates — or is
intended to generate — revenue, directly or indirectly. This includes prototypes
intended for commercial release.

"Enterprise Use" means use of Wake by any organization with five (5) or more
employees OR annual gross revenue of USD 500,000 or more, regardless of the
project scale.

"Derivative Work" means any modification, adaptation, port, or integration of
Wake or its components. This does not include applications that merely use
Wake's public APIs or JIT runtime without incorporating Wake's source or
binary code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. LICENSE GRANT – PERSONAL & EDUCATIONAL USE (FREE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Majify grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to install
and use Wake for Personal or Educational Use.

You may:
- Use Wake on your personal computer or lab environments;
- Develop applications, demos, research, prototypes, and creative experiments;
- Publish screenshots, videos, academic results, or non-commercial prototypes;
- Share Wake-based content as long as no Wake binaries are redistributed.

You may NOT:
- Distribute Wake binaries (.exe, .dll, .so, .lib) or modified versions;
- Sell any product, tool, or service that embeds, links, loads, bundles, or
  relies on Wake;
- Create a competing engine, framework, or runtime derived from Wake;
- Bypass, remove, or tamper with Wake’s signature, verification, or security;
- Reverse engineer Wake’s signing keys or proprietary components.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. COMMERCIAL USE – FUTURE REQUIREMENT NOTICE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake is currently free for small creators and independent developers.
A dedicated Commercial License for revenue-generating projects will be
introduced in a future version of Wake.

Until that update:
- Small independent developers (<5 employees AND <500k USD/year) may prototype
  non-commercially.
- Any revenue-generating release must wait for Wake’s official commercial
  licensing terms OR contact Majify for pre-release licensing.

This ensures fairness: individuals can experiment freely, while commercial
adoption is controlled and licensed appropriately when the engine matures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. ENTERPRISE USE (REQUIRES LICENSE NOW)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any Enterprise Use (5+ employees OR 500k+ USD annual revenue) requires a valid
Commercial License with Majify Technologies Inc. — effective immediately.

Enterprise Use includes:
- Internal tools, automation pipelines, dashboards, visualization systems;
- Commercial hardware/software integration;
- Studio workflows, production tools, XR/VR pipelines, or rendering systems;
- Products distributed through app stores, Steam, SaaS platforms, or any
  revenue-generating channel.

5. OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake and all associated components remain the exclusive property of Majify.
No ownership rights are transferred.

Voluntary feedback or contributions (issues, pull requests, documentation)
grant Majify a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use them.

This does NOT apply to independent modules, tools, or apps that interact with
Wake solely through public APIs.

Trademarks “Wake”, “Wake JIT Engine”, “Majify”, and related logos are
registered or pending trademarks of Majify Technologies Inc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SECURITY, SIGNING, AND REDISTRIBUTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Official Wake modules use Ed25519 signing. Only modules signed by Majify or
authorized partners are recognized.

You may not:
- Redistribute Wake binaries;
- Distribute modified binaries or manifests;
- Circumvent signature verification.

Users acknowledge that no software provides perfect protection against malicious
scripts or third-party code. You are responsible for verifying any `.jc`,
`.sm`, or `.wpkg` file executed through Wake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. OPEN-SOURCE COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open-source projects under OSI-approved licenses may use Wake for development
and non-commercial distribution, provided that:
- Wake itself is not redistributed, and
- no commercial revenue is generated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake is provided “AS IS”, without warranties of any kind. Majify shall not be
liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use Wake.

Third-party modules, scripts, shaders, AI models, or packages executed by Wake
are the sole responsibility of the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. TERMINATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any violation of this License immediately terminates your rights. You must
cease use and destroy all copies.

Majify reserves the right to revoke keys or licenses in cases of fraudulent,
abusive, harmful, or unauthorized use.

Wake may not be used to create or distribute malware, exploits, or harmful
software.
